## Intro ##

Specs code implements [several heuristic methods](http://eopsf.org/cube/help/help.html#refs) for detection of conserved regions on protein sequence and structure. 
The purpose of such an exercise is, typically, to help in the rational design of single-site mutational experiments,
to estimate the impact of SNPs - inherited or arising in cancerous cells, or to guide computational docking.

To see the code at work on precompiled vertebrate sequences check out [CubeDB server](http://cube.monogenic.org). 
To try it on your own set of seqeunces you can visit [Cube server](http:/cube.monogenic.org). 
To compile an run locally, read on.
